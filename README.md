#SASS
* Sass stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet
* Sass is an extension to CSS
* Sass is a CSS pre-processor
* Sass is completely compatible with all versions of CSS
* Sass reduces repetition of CSS and therefore saves time
* Sass is free to download and use
* Two syntaxes available:
⋅⋅⋅SCSS (Sassy CSS): This is an extension of the CSS syntax, meaning that every valid CSS file is also a valid SCSS file with the same meaning
⋅⋅⋅Sass syntax (also known as indented syntax): Older syntax that uses indentation instead of brackets to indicate nesting and uses newlines instead of semicolons to separate different properties
